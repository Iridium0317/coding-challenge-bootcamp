# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum 长度最小的子数组
[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

**Problem**  
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the **minimal length** of a **subarray** whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

**Example**

```text
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1

Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
*   1 <= target <= 10^9
*   1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
*   1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

```text
这还是一个滑动窗口的题
```

### Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        current_sum = 0
        min_len = float('inf') # 无穷大，用来找最小值
        for right, num in enumerate(nums):
            current_sum += num
            while current_sum>= target:
                l = right - left + 1
                if l < min_len:
                    min_len = l
                current_sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1
        
        return 0 if min_len == float('inf') else min_len

# 904. Fruit Into Baskets
[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.cn/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)

**Problem**  
You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the **type** of fruit the `i`th tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

1.  You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
2.  Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
3.  Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return *the **maximum** number of fruits you can pick*.

**Example**

```text
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.

Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].

Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
```

**Constraints:**
*   1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5
*   0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length

## My Understanding

### Note
```text
1. 因为不能简单拿最右边的数值和最左边的数值比较，决定是否删除最左边数。要比较的数值 不只是最左边的。因为也有可能是[1,2,1,2] right指向2 和 1 不同，但是不用删掉第一个1，所以要想新的办法->哈希表 起到计数器的作用
```

### Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict

        left = 0
        k = 2
        basket = {}
        max_len = 0
        for right, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
            basket[fruit] = basket.get(fruit, 0) + 1

            while len(basket) > 2:
                basket[fruits[left]] -= 1
                if basket[fruits[left]] == 0:
                    del basket[fruits[left]]
                left += 1
                
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
        return max_len
```

# 76. Minimum Window Substring
[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

**Problem**  
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window substring** of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` *(including duplicates) is included in the window*. If there is no such substring, return *the empty string* `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example**

```text
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

**Constraints:**
*   m == s.length
*   n == t.length
*   1 <= m, n <= 10^5
*   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
