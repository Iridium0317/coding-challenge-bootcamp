# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.cn/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

**Problem**  
Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the $n^{th}$ node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example**

```text
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: The second node from the end is 4, removing it leaves 1->2->3->5.
```

**My Understanding**

```text

```

**Solution**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Use a dummy node to handle edge cases easily (e.g., removing the head)
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        slow = dummy
        fast = dummy
        
        # Move fast pointer n + 1 steps ahead
        # This ensures that when fast reaches the end, slow is just before the target node
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next
            
        # Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
        while fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
            
        # Skip the desired node
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        
        return dummy.next
```
**Note**

*   Time Complexity: $O(N)$ (One pass)
*   Space Complexity: $O(1)$
