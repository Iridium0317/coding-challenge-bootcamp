# 142. Linked List Cycle II

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.cn/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)


**Problem**  
Given the `head` of a linked list, return *the node where the cycle begins*. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

**Example**

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**My Understanding**

```text

```

**Solution**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        # 第一阶段：判断有没有环 
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next       # 慢走1步
            fast = fast.next.next  # 快走2步
            
            # 撞上了！说明有环
            if slow == fast:
                
                # 第二阶段：找入口 (数学魔术 X = Z)
                # 让 slow 留在原地，把 fast (或新建一个指针) 扔回起点
                fast = head
                
                # 两个人这次都只走 1 步
                while slow != fast:
                    slow = slow.next
                    fast = fast.next
                
                # 再次相遇的点，绝对是入口
                return slow
        
        # 跑到底了都没相遇，说明没环
        return None
```
**Note**

*   Time Complexity: $O()$
*   Space Complexity: $O()$
