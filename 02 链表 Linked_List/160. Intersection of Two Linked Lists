# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.cn/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)


**Problem**  
Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Example**

```text
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**My Understanding**

```text

```

**Solution**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # 边界检查
        if not headA or not headB:
            return None
        
        pA = headA
        pB = headB
        
        # 只要两人没相遇，就一直跑
        # 即使没有交点，两人最后都会变成 None，也会相等 (None == None)，退出循环
        while pA != pB:
            # A 走完了吗？走完了去 B 的头，没走完继续走
            pA = headB if pA is None else pA.next

            pB = headA if pB is None else pB.next
            
        return pA
        
```
**Note**

*   Time Complexity: $O(M + N)$ (Where M and N are the lengths of the two lists)
*   Space Complexity: $O(1)$
